# Language Processors Coursework
This coursework is divided in two parts, each with different tasks and submission deadlines.

- Part 1 - Building a parser
- Part 2 - Building a compiler

Both parts implement the MOOPL language (Mini Object Oriented Programming Language), which is a cut-down version of Java.


## Part 1
The first part of the coursework focuses on syntax & grammar, and abstract syntax trees. The solution to this part can be found in the directory marked _COURSEWORK PART 1_.

The tasks given to us were completing the `TOKEN` definitions in the *Moopl-grammar.jj* file (only two or three were already in there), completing the grammar productions (with each method returning void), and adding semantic actions in a copy of the main *.jj* file that would return an appropriate type of AST. We were also asked to checked whether the ASTs built by our parser were correct by using the pretty-printer.

## Part 2
